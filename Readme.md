## Implementations Explained

* **Picture Hack** This has two Python files
  * **1-** server.py --> This file should be running on the Host Pc, in Powershell or any Command line, It will provide you the hacked Data.
  * **2-** file.py --> this file will run on victum's PC, for gathering data.
  * **3-** *Working* --> This code will be sending you all the pictures from the host device, It will not send every single picture but will send only those that are present in any of the user directory, in order to avoid irrelevent images (like program logos), on the Host's Server.
